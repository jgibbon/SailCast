# SailCast
Screencasting app for Sailfish OS. Streams MJPEG over socket, screen contents grabbed through Linux framebuffer.

# Usage

Just hit start button and the app will start listening on address provided in below buttons.

## Notes

Tested only on Firefox. Chrome requires that the mjpeg stream is embedded into html element so the stream won't show up when the plain address is accessed.
